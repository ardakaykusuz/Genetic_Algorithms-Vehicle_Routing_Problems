Solving Vehicle Routing Issues with Genetic Algorithms

This project tackles the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The goal is to optimize delivery routes for a fleet of vehicles with limited capacity. The report details a chromosome representation for solutions, where each gene signifies a customer visit. A fitness function evaluates route efficiency based on travel distance and penalties for exceeding capacity. 3 selection methods (tournament, fitness proportionate, roulette wheel) were compared and Tournament selection yielded the best performance. 4 mutation methods (swap, merge and split, hop, dream team) were investigated and merge and split mutation proved most effective. 3 crossover methods (group-based, eager breeder, twin maker) were analyzed, and group-based crossover achieved the lowest average fitness. A comprehensive grid search identified the best combination of operators: tournament selection, twin maker crossover, and merge and split mutation. This combination achieved rapid convergence to high fitness values. The project highlights the importance of selecting appropriate genetic operators for the problem at hand.
